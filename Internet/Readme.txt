Here's the chipertext analysizer for cracking XOR Encripted file. 
There are so many applications using the simple XOR encription as security tool. If u want to know the
quality of the XOR encription, u can use this application for testing it. By this u can see the value of any character
and u can change the character in the chipertext with yours. 
Beside that, by this application u can learn how to crack your XOR encription and repair yours. 

Remember : If you know a part of chipertext (encripted text) maybe you can guess the other. 
You should know the last character in a sentence is a point (.) commonly. 
The word which has one character is "a".
The word which has three character in front of sentence maybe is "the"
And soon
So you can change the character with yours by this application (using pair characters).
